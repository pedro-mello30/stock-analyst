# Income Statement Analysis Framework

## Revenue Analysis Questions

### Revenue Quality
- [ ] Is revenue **recurring** or does the company start fresh each year?
- [ ] Are there **consistent and sustainable** growth patterns?
- [ ] What **temporary factors** (tailwinds/headwinds) affected this period?

### Revenue Sources
- [ ] What percentage comes from products vs services vs royalties?
- [ ] How diversified are revenue streams?
- [ ] Any customer concentration risks?

## Margin Analysis

### Gross Margin Assessment
- [ ] Calculate gross margin: `(Revenue - COGS) / Revenue`
- [ ] Compare to industry peers
- [ ] Is it above 40%? (Buffett's threshold for competitive advantage)
- [ ] Trend: improving, stable, or declining?

### Operating Margin Assessment
- [ ] Calculate operating margin: `Operating Income / Revenue`
- [ ] Compare to direct competitors
- [ ] Identify cost structure drivers

### Expense Breakdown
- [ ] S&M as % of revenue (efficiency of sales motion)
- [ ] R&D as % of revenue (innovation investment)
- [ ] G&A as % of revenue (overhead efficiency)
- [ ] D&A impact (capital intensity)

## Time-Based Comparison Checklist

Analyze trends over multiple periods for:

| Signal | What to Look For |
|--------|------------------|
| **Market share gains** | Revenue growing faster than industry/peers |
| **Unit economics strength** | Gross margins stable or improving |
| **Operating leverage** | Operating margins improving as revenue scales |
| **Sales efficiency** | S&M as % of revenue declining |
| **Path to profitability** | Margins steadily improving (even if still negative) |

## Net Income Context Questions

Before concluding on profitability:

1. **Non-recurring items**: Were there one-time expenses/gains distorting the period?
2. **Growth investment**: Is management aggressively reinvesting (lowering current profits)?
3. **Maturity stage**: Is this a mature company optimizing for profits or a growth company investing?
4. **GAAP vs Non-GAAP**: If using adjusted metrics, what's being excluded and why?

## Competitive Benchmarking Process

1. **Identify direct competitors** (same industry, similar business model)
2. **Gather comparable metrics**:
   - Gross margin
   - Operating margin
   - Revenue growth rate
   - S&M efficiency
3. **Normalize for differences** (geography, scale, business mix)
4. **Draw conclusions** about competitive position

## Red Flags to Watch

- Gross margins declining faster than peers
- Operating expenses growing faster than revenue
- Significant gap between GAAP and Non-GAAP results
- Heavy reliance on non-recurring gains for profitability
- Stock-based compensation excluded from "adjusted" metrics
- Revenue growth decelerating without margin expansion
