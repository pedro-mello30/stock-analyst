# Income Statement Metrics & Formulas

## Core Components

### Revenue (Top Line)
Money coming into the business:
- **Product sales**: Physical goods sold
- **Service sales**: Services provided
- **Royalties**: IP licensing fees

### Expenses

**Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Direct production costs varying with revenue (raw materials, labor, delivery)

**Operating Expenses (OPEX)**:
- **S&M**: Selling & Marketing
- **R&D**: Research & Development
- **G&A**: General & Administrative
- **D&A**: Depreciation & Amortization (non-cash)

### Net Income (Bottom Line)
Profit after all expenses. Can be negative (net loss).

## Key Margin Formulas

### Gross Margin
```
Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue × 100
```
- Indicates earning potential before operating costs
- **Benchmark**: Warren Buffett targets ≥40% (indicates pricing power)

### Operating Margin
```
Operating Margin = Operating Income / Revenue × 100
```
- Reflects "real" profit from core operations
- Most important profitability metric

### Net Margin
```
Net Margin = Net Income / Revenue × 100
```
- Final profit after all expenses and taxes
- Can be distorted by non-recurring items

### Earnings Per Share (EPS)
```
EPS = Net Income / Outstanding Shares
```
- EPS can grow faster than net income if shares are repurchased
- EPS can grow slower if new shares are issued

| Company | Operating Margin | Business Model |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| Amazon | ~2% | Low-price retail focus |
| Microsoft | ~43% | Software-based |
| Google | ~30% | Digital advertising |
| Costco | ~3% | Low-price membership retail |

## GAAP vs Non-GAAP

### GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)
- Standardized framework for all companies
- Only metrics that matter long-term
- Enable fair cross-company comparisons

### Non-GAAP (Adjusted) Metrics
| Metric | Excludes |
|--------|----------|
| EBITDA | Depreciation, Amortization, Interest, Taxes |
| EBIT | Interest, Taxes |
| Adjusted EPS | One-time/unusual charges |
| Pro Forma Revenue | Acquisition/divestiture adjustments |

**Warning**: Non-GAAP can obscure performance. Stock-based compensation exclusions are particularly questionable—compensation is a real cost.

## Valuation Multiples

### Price-to-Sales (P/S)
```
P/S = Market Capitalization / Revenue
```
Useful for unprofitable or high-growth companies.

### Price-to-Earnings (P/E)
```
P/E = Market Capitalization / Net Income
```
Standard valuation metric for profitable companies.
