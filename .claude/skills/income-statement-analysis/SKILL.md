# Income Statement Analysis

Structured approach to analyzing a company's income statement based on the App Economy Insights methodology.

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. Gather the Data

Obtain the income statement data:
- Quarterly (10-Q) or Annual (10-K) filings
- Multiple periods for trend analysis (minimum 4 quarters or 2-3 years)
- Competitor data for benchmarking

### 2. Analyze Revenue (Top Line)

Evaluate revenue quality:
- **Recurring vs non-recurring**: Does the company start fresh each year?
- **Growth consistency**: Sustainable patterns or volatile?
- **Temporary factors**: Identify tailwinds/headwinds affecting the period

### 3. Calculate Key Margins

```
Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue
Operating Margin = Operating Income / Revenue
Net Margin = Net Income / Revenue
EPS = Net Income / Outstanding Shares
```

For formulas and benchmarks: See [references/metrics-formulas.md](references/metrics-formulas.md)

### 4. Assess Operating Expenses

Break down OPEX as percentage of revenue:
- **S&M %**: Sales efficiency (declining = good operating leverage)
- **R&D %**: Innovation investment level
- **G&A %**: Administrative overhead
- **D&A**: Capital intensity indicator

### 5. Compare Across Time

Look for these signals over multiple periods:
- Revenue growth vs peers (market share)
- Gross margin stability (unit economics)
- Operating margin improvement (operating leverage)
- S&M efficiency gains (scalability)

### 6. Benchmark Against Competitors

Compare metrics to direct competitors in same industry. Context matters—Amazon's 2% operating margin is excellent for retail, weak for software.

### 7. Evaluate GAAP vs Non-GAAP

If company reports adjusted metrics:
- Identify what's excluded
- Question stock-based compensation exclusions
- GAAP metrics are the only ones that matter long-term

## Output Structure

Present analysis as:

1. **Revenue Assessment**: Quality, growth, sustainability
2. **Margin Analysis**: Gross → Operating → Net with trends
3. **Expense Efficiency**: OPEX breakdown and trends
4. **Competitive Position**: vs peers
5. **Key Risks/Red Flags**: Any concerns identified
6. **Summary**: Overall financial health assessment
