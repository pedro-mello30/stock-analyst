## Core Components

### Assets

**Current Assets** (convertible to cash within 1 year):
- **Cash & Equivalents**: Liquid funds
- **Accounts Receivable**: Money owed by customers
- **Inventory**: Goods held for sale
- **Prepaid Expenses**: Advance payments

**Non-Current Assets** (conversion > 1 year):
- **Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E)**: Fixed assets
- **Intangible Assets**: Patents, trademarks, goodwill
- **Long-term Investments**: Securities, subsidiaries
- **Goodwill**: Premium paid over fair value in acquisitions

### Liabilities

**Current Liabilities** (due within 1 year):
- **Accounts Payable**: Money owed to suppliers
- **Accrued Expenses**: Incurred but unpaid costs
- **Short-term Debt**: Loans due within 1 year
- **Deferred Revenue**: Prepaid customer obligations

**Non-Current Liabilities** (due after 1 year):
- **Long-term Debt**: Bonds, loans
- **Pension Liabilities**: Employee retirement obligations
- **Other Long-term Obligations**: Leases, deferred taxes

### Shareholders' Equity

- **Share Capital**: Investor contributions
- **Retained Earnings**: Accumulated profits not distributed
- **Treasury Stock**: Repurchased shares (reduces equity)
- **Reserve Accounts**: Statutory or discretionary reserves

## Liquidity Ratios

### Current Ratio
```
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
```
- **Target**: > 1.0 (higher is better)
- **Interpretation**: Ability to pay short-term obligations
- **Warning**: < 1.0 indicates potential liquidity issues

### Quick Ratio (Acid-Test)
```
Quick Ratio = (Cash + Short-term Investments + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities
```
- **Target**: > 1.0
- **Interpretation**: Liquidity without relying on inventory
- **Use case**: Better for companies with slow-moving inventory

### Cash Ratio
```
Cash Ratio = Cash & Equivalents / Current Liabilities
```
- **Interpretation**: Most conservative liquidity measure
- **Target**: Varies by industry

## Solvency Ratios

### Debt-to-Equity Ratio
```
Debt-to-Equity = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity
```
- **Target**: ~1.0 is considered healthy
- **Interpretation**: Financial leverage level
- **Warning**: > 2.0 may indicate excessive leverage

### Debt-to-Assets Ratio
```
Debt-to-Assets = Total Debt / Total Assets
```
- **Interpretation**: Percentage of assets financed by debt
- **Lower is better**: Less financial risk

### Interest Coverage Ratio
```
Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest Expense
```
- **Target**: > 3.0 is comfortable
- **Warning**: < 2.0 indicates difficulty servicing debt
- **Note**: Requires income statement data

### Equity Multiplier
```
Equity Multiplier = Total Assets / Shareholders' Equity
```
- **Interpretation**: Degree of leverage
- **Higher**: More debt financing relative to equity

---

## Efficiency Ratios

### Asset Turnover
```
Asset Turnover = Revenue / Total Assets
```
- **Interpretation**: Revenue generated per dollar of assets
- **Higher is better**: More efficient asset use
- **Industry-dependent**: Retail > Software

### Receivables Turnover
```
Receivables Turnover = Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable
```
- **Interpretation**: How quickly receivables are collected
- **Higher is better**: Faster collection

### Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
```
DSO = (Accounts Receivable / Revenue) x 365
```
- **Interpretation**: Average collection period in days
- **Lower is better**: Faster cash conversion

### Inventory Turnover
```
Inventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory
```
- **Interpretation**: How quickly inventory sells
- **Higher is better**: Efficient inventory management

### Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)
```
DIO = (Inventory / COGS) x 365
```
- **Interpretation**: Days to sell inventory
- **Lower is better**: Faster inventory movement

## Profitability Ratios

### Return on Assets (ROA)
```
ROA = Net Income / Total Assets
```
- **Interpretation**: Profit generated per dollar of assets
- **Higher is better**
- **Industry benchmarks**: Varies significantly

### Return on Equity (ROE)
```
ROE = Net Income / Shareholders' Equity
```
- **Target**: 15-20% is strong
- **Warning**: Very high ROE may indicate excessive leverage
- **Benchmark**: Compare to cost of equity

### Goodwill-to-Assets
```
Goodwill-to-Assets = Goodwill / Total Assets
```
- **Interpretation**: Acquisition dependency
- **Warning**: > 25% suggests acquisition-heavy growth
- **Risk**: Potential impairment charges

## DuPont Analysis

Decompose ROE into three drivers:

```
ROE = Net Margin x Asset Turnover x Equity Multiplier

    = (Net Income / Revenue) x (Revenue / Assets) x (Assets / Equity)
```

| Component | Measures |
|-----------|----------|
| **Net Margin** | Profitability |
| **Asset Turnover** | Efficiency |
| **Equity Multiplier** | Leverage |

## Key Benchmarks

### Warren Buffett's Debt Test
```
Long-term Debt / Annual Earnings < 3-4 years
```
- Company should be able to pay off all long-term debt within 3-4 years of earnings

### Industry Reference Points
