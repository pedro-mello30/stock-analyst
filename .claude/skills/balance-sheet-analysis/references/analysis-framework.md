## Liquidity Assessment Checklist

| Metric | Calculation | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Current Ratio** | Current Assets / Current Liabilities | > 1.0 |
| **Quick Ratio** | (Cash + S-T Investments + A/R) / Current Liabilities | > 1.0 |
| **Cash Ratio** | Cash / Current Liabilities | Varies by industry |

Questions to answer:
- [ ] Can the company meet short-term obligations?
- [ ] Is liquidity improving or deteriorating over time?
- [ ] How does liquidity compare to peers?

---

## Solvency Assessment Checklist

| Metric | Calculation | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Debt-to-Equity** | Total Liabilities / Total Equity | Lower = less risky |
| **Interest Coverage** | EBIT / Interest Expense | Higher = safer |
| **Debt-to-Assets** | Total Debt / Total Assets | Lower = less leveraged |

Questions to answer:
- [ ] Can the company meet long-term obligations?
- [ ] Is leverage increasing or decreasing?
- [ ] How does solvency compare to industry norms?

---

## Efficiency Assessment Checklist

| Metric | Calculation | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Asset Turnover** | Revenue / Total Assets | Higher = more efficient |
| **Receivables Turnover** | Revenue / Avg Accounts Receivable | Higher = faster collection |
| **Inventory Turnover** | COGS / Avg Inventory | Higher = faster sales |

Questions to answer:
- [ ] Is the company using assets efficiently?
- [ ] Are there working capital concerns?
- [ ] How does efficiency compare to competitors?

## Profitability from Balance Sheet

| Metric | Calculation | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Return on Assets (ROA)** | Net Income / Total Assets | Higher = better asset utilization |
| **Return on Equity (ROE)** | Net Income / Shareholders' Equity | Higher = better returns for shareholders |

---

## Red Flags to Watch

- Goodwill exceeding 25% of total assets (acquisition risk)
- Negative or declining retained earnings
- Current ratio below 1.0 (liquidity risk)
- Debt-to-equity above 2.0 without clear justification
- Rapidly growing accounts receivable vs revenue (collection issues)
- Inventory growing faster than sales (obsolescence risk)
- Interest coverage below 2.0 (debt servicing risk)
- Long-term debt exceeding 4 years of annual earnings

## Comparative Analysis Process

1. **Trend Analysis**: Track key metrics over 4+ quarters or 2-3 years
2. **Peer Comparison**: Benchmark against direct competitors
3. **Common-Size Analysis**: Express all items as % of total assets
4. **DuPont Analysis**: Decompose ROE into profitability, efficiency, and leverage

### DuPont Formula
```
ROE = Net Margin x Asset Turnover x Equity Multiplier
    = (Net Income/Revenue) x (Revenue/Assets) x (Assets/Equity)
```
