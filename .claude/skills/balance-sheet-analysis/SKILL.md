# Balance Sheet Analysis

Structured approach to analyzing a company's balance sheet based on the App Economy Insights methodology.

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. Gather the Data

Obtain balance sheet data:
- Quarterly (10-Q) or Annual (10-K) filings
- Multiple periods for trend analysis (minimum 4 quarters or 2-3 years)
- Competitor data for benchmarking
- Income statement data for profitability ratios (ROA, ROE)

### 2. Analyze Assets

Evaluate asset composition:
- **Current vs Non-current**: Asset liquidity profile
- **Cash position**: Strength and trend
- **Receivables**: Collection efficiency (watch for growth outpacing revenue)
- **Inventory**: Turnover and obsolescence risk
- **Goodwill**: Acquisition dependency (warning if >25% of total assets)

### 3. Analyze Liabilities

Evaluate debt structure:
- **Current vs Long-term**: Maturity profile
- **Short-term debt**: Refinancing risk
- **Long-term debt**: Can it be paid off in 3-4 years of earnings? (Buffett test)
- **Deferred revenue**: Positive signal for recurring business

### 4. Assess Shareholders' Equity

Evaluate ownership value:
- **Retained earnings**: Positive and growing?
- **Treasury stock**: Share buyback activity
- **Equity trend**: Building or eroding over time?

### 5. Calculate Key Ratios

```
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
Quick Ratio = (Cash + ST Investments + A/R) / Current Liabilities
Debt-to-Equity = Total Liabilities / Total Equity
ROA = Net Income / Total Assets
ROE = Net Income / Shareholders' Equity
```

For complete formulas and benchmarks: See [references/metrics-formulas.md](references/metrics-formulas.md)

### 6. Evaluate Financial Health

Assess four key traits:
- **Liquidity**: Can short-term obligations be met? (Current ratio > 1.0)
- **Solvency**: Can long-term debts be serviced? (Interest coverage > 3.0)
- **Efficiency**: Are assets being used productively? (Asset turnover)
- **Profitability**: Are assets generating returns? (ROA, ROE)

### 7. Compare and Benchmark

Perform comparative analysis:
- **Trend Analysis**: Track changes over multiple periods
- **Peer Comparison**: Benchmark against competitors
- **Common-Size Analysis**: Express items as % of total assets
- **DuPont Analysis**: Decompose ROE into margin, turnover, leverage

For complete checklist: See [references/analysis-framework.md](references/analysis-framework.md)

## Output Structure

Present analysis as:

1. **Asset Quality**: Composition, liquidity, and efficiency
2. **Liability Assessment**: Debt levels, maturity, and risk
3. **Equity Position**: Retained earnings, capital structure
4. **Liquidity Analysis**: Current ratio, quick ratio with trends
5. **Solvency Analysis**: Debt-to-equity, interest coverage
6. **Profitability**: ROA, ROE, DuPont decomposition
7. **Red Flags**: Any concerns identified
8. **Summary**: Overall financial health assessment

## Critical Context

Balance sheets cannot be analyzed in a vacuum. Connect findings to:
- **Income Statement**: For profitability ratios and interest coverage
- **Cash Flow Statement**: For actual cash generation vs balance sheet changes
