# Cash Flow Analysis Framework

Follow this structured framework to analyze a company's Cash Flow Statement (Statement of Cash Flows).

## Step 1: Analyze Operating Activities
*Primary Goal: Understand how much cash the core business generates.*

- **Net Income to Cash Reconcilliation**: Identify major non-cash add-backs (Depreciation & Amortization, Stock-Based Compensation).
- **Working Capital Changes**: Check if cash is tied up in accounts receivable or inventory, or if accounts payable is being stretched.
- **Operating Cash Flow (OCF) Trend**: Is it positive? Is it growing? Is it consistently higher than Net Income?

## Step 2: Analyze Investing Activities
*Primary Goal: Evaluate how much the company is investing in its future growth.*

- **Capital Expenditures (CapEx)**: How much is being spent on property, plant, and equipment (PP&E)?
- **Acquisitions vs. Divestitures**: Is the company growing through M&A? Is it selling off non-core assets?
- **Investment Portfolio**: Are they buying/selling marketable securities?

## Step 3: Analyze Financing Activities
*Primary Goal: See how the company funds its operations and returns value to shareholders.*

- **Debt Activity**: Issuing new debt vs. repaying existing debt.
- **Equity Activity**: Issuing new shares vs. repurchasing shares (Buybacks).
- **Dividends**: Is the company paying out a portion of cash to owners?

## Step 4: Quantitative Checklist
- [ ] Calculate **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**: OCF - CapEx.
- [ ] Compare **OCF to Net Income**: OCF should ideally be > Net Income.
- [ ] Check **SBC % of OCF**: Is Stock-Based Compensation a significant portion of cash from operations?
- [ ] **FCF Yield**: FCF / Market Cap (needs external data if not in filing).

## Step 5: Interpretation & Synthesis
- **Cash Flow Profile**:
    - *Mature/Healthy*: Positive OCF, Negative Investing (reinvesting), Negative Financing (paying down debt/buybacks).
    - *Growth/Aggressive*: Negative OCF (maybe), Very Negative Investing (heavy Capex/M&A), Positive Financing (raising cash).
    - *Struggling*: Negative OCF, Positive Investing (selling assets), Positive Financing (raising debt to survive).
- **Sustainability**: Is FCF sufficient to cover dividends and debt obligations?
