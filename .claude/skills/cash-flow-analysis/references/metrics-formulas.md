# Cash Flow Metrics & Formulas

Use these primary metrics to evaluate a company's cash flow strength and sustainability.

| Metric | Formula | Significance | Benchmarks/Notes |
|--------|---------|--------------|------------------|
| **Operating Cash Flow (OCF)** | Net Income + Non-cash Expenses +/- Δ Working Capital | The actual "green" cash generated by core operations. | Should be positive for mature companies. |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCF)** | Operating Cash Flow - CapEx | The cash left over after maintaining/expanding assets. | Available for dividends, buybacks, and debt repayment. |
| **OCF / Net Income** | Operating Cash Flow ÷ Net Income | Measures "Earnings Quality". | A ratio > 1 suggests high quality earnings (cash > accounting profit). |
| **FCF / Revenue** | Free Cash Flow ÷ Revenue | FCF Margin. | Software/Big Tech often > 20%. Manufacturing varies. |
| **CapEx / OCF** | Capital Expenditures ÷ OCF | Capital Intensity. | < 20% is light; > 50% is heavy/capital intensive. |
| **OCF / Debt** | Operating Cash Flow ÷ Total Debt | Cash Flow Coverage. | Ability to pay off total debt using one year's cash flow. |

## Qualitative Considerations

### Stock-Based Compensation (SBC)
SBC is a non-cash expense added back to OCF. While it helps cash flow today, it causes dilution tomorrow.
- **Red Flag**: SBC as a massive % of OCF (e.g., > 30% for mature tech companies).
- **Check**: Is the company buying back enough shares to offset the SBC dilution?

### Working Capital Management
- **Inventory Growth > Revenue Growth**: Possible sign of slowing demand or obsolete products.
- **A/R Growth > Revenue Growth**: Possible sign of aggressive revenue recognition or collection issues.
- **A/P Growth**: Stretching out suppliers can inflate OCF temporarily.
