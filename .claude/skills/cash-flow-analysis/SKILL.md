# Cash Flow Analysis

## Overview

This skill provides a structured 5-step methodology to analyze a company's Statement of Cash Flows, enabling accurate assessment of financial health, earnings quality, and capital allocation strategy.

## Analysis Workflow

Follow these steps sequentially when analyzing a cash flow statement:

### 1. Operating Activities Evaluation
Assess the core business's ability to generate cash.
- Look for non-cash adjustments (D&A, Stock-Based Compensation).
- Analyze Working Capital changes (Inventory, A/R, A/P).
- **Reference**: Use `references/analysis-framework.md` (Step 1) for detailed checks.

### 2. Investing Activities Analysis
Determine how the company is deploying capital for future growth.
- Prioritize Capital Expenditures (CapEx) vs. M&A activity.
- **Reference**: Use `references/analysis-framework.md` (Step 2).

### 3. Financing Activities Assessment
Review how the company funds itself and returns capital to investors.
- Track debt issuance/repayment and share buybacks/dividends.
- **Reference**: Use `references/analysis-framework.md` (Step 3).

### 4. Quantitative Metrics Calculation
Calculate key performance indicators to benchmark against industry standards.
- Calculate **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**: Operating Cash Flow - CapEx.
- Analyze **Earnings Quality**: Operating Cash Flow / Net Income.
- **Reference**: See `references/metrics-formulas.md` for all formulas and benchmarks.

### 5. Synthesis & Profile Identification
Identify the company's "Cash Flow Profile" (Mature, Growth, or Struggling) and summarize findings.
- **Reference**: Use `references/analysis-framework.md` (Step 5).
