# How to Analyze a Stock: 6 Questions to Ask Before Buying

## 1. What's the Business?

### Mission
Every great company starts with a mission—the "why" behind what they do. A clear mission can inspire employees, attract customers, and drive long-term success. For example, Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.

Ask yourself: Does the company's mission align with a positive secular trend or unmet need?

### Leadership
The team at the top makes all the difference. Founder-led companies or CEOs with a successful track record tend to outperform the market. Leaders with significant stock ownership often signal alignment with shareholders. Consider their vision, communication style, and ability to execute. Are they consistent? Do they receive high approval scores from employees on platforms like Glassdoor, Comparably, or Great Place To Work?

### Products
What does the company actually offer? Are its products or services essential, innovative, or part of a growing market? Consider how these offerings solve problems or improve lives. What sets it apart? Pay attention to the company's competitive position—are its products unique, or do they risk becoming commodities or obsolete?

## 2. How Do They Make Money?

### Revenue Mix
Start by breaking down the company's revenue streams. Does the business rely on a single product or service, or is it diversified across multiple offerings and geographies? A diversified revenue mix often means more stability, while dependency on one source could be a red flag. High customer concentration can indicate higher disruption risk if the market turns.

### Unit Economics
Dig deeper into the building blocks of profitability. Gross margin shows how much is left after the company delivers its product or service. Look for signs of scalability—do margins improve as the business grows? For example, 60% of Amazon's operating profit comes from its cloud infrastructure service, AWS.

### Key Metrics
Not all metrics are born equal. For e-commerce, gross merchandise value (GMV) and take rate might be key drivers. For subscription-based businesses, annual recurring revenue (ARR) and retention could tell the story. Always identify the one or two metrics that best reflect the company's momentum. Pay attention to the trend over several quarters and years.

## 3. What Could Go Right?

### Market Growth
A rising tide lifts all boats. If the company operates in a growing industry, it benefits from tailwinds even without being the market leader. Look for secular trends like e-commerce, streaming, renewable energy, or AI adoption. Is the company positioned to ride this wave?

### New Products and Innovation
Innovation keeps a business relevant. New products or services can unlock growth, enter untapped markets, or deepen customer loyalty. A history of new product releases that delight customers and expand the addressable market is extremely valuable. Look for signs of ongoing R&D investment and management's focus on staying ahead of the curve.

### Moat Expansion
A strong competitive advantage—or "moat"—can protect a company from rivals. It could be a powerful brand, network effects, proprietary technology, or cost leadership. The question is: Can the company widen its moat over time?

## 4. What Could Go Wrong?

### Market Disruption
Even the strongest industries can experience upheaval. Emerging technologies, regulatory changes, or shifting consumer preferences can render business models obsolete. Ask yourself: Is this company prepared for sudden changes in its market?

### Competition
Every company faces rivals, but some industries are more cutthroat than others. Competitors with deeper pockets, better technology, or stronger brands can erode market share. Watch out for price wars, declining margins, or signs that rivals are gaining ground faster.

### Moat Erosion
A shrinking moat is a big red flag. A brand can lose its luster, a patent can expire, or customer loyalty can fade. Consider how vulnerable the company's competitive advantage is to being copied, bypassed, or outspent. Declining revenue per customer can indicate fading pricing power. Worsening retention metrics can signal competitive pressure.

## 5. What Do the Numbers Say?

### Profitability
The income statement (P&L) reveals whether the company makes money and how efficiently. Key metrics to watch: revenue growth, gross margin, operating margin, and net income. Look for consistent growth and improving margins over time.

### Solvency
A company's balance sheet tells you how financially stable it is. Key indicators: debt-to-equity ratio (is the company overleveraged?), cash reserves (does it have a safety net?), and assets versus liabilities (can it cover its obligations?). A strong balance sheet acts as a buffer during tough times.

### Liquidity
Cash is king. The cash flow statement shows whether the company generates enough cash to fund operations and growth. Free cash flow (cash left after expenses and capital investments) is particularly important, fueling dividends, buybacks, or acquisitions. Positive and consistent cash flow signals sustainability.

## 6. Is the Price Right?

### Which Metrics to Focus On?
Valuation isn't one-size-fits-all. It all depends on the company's growth stage. For mature companies, focus on Price-to-Earnings (P/E) or EV/EBITDA. For young companies still growing fast and losing money, Price-to-Sales (P/S) or EV/Revenue might be more relevant.

Investing is about the future, not the past. Use forward-looking valuation metrics. The goal is to understand what you're paying relative to the company's future earnings potential. Compare these metrics to peers and the broader market to gain context on alternatives.

### Investment Horizon
How long do you plan to hold this stock? The longer you hold a stock, the less its exact valuation at the time of purchase matters. A premium price might be justified if the company has years of growth ahead.

### Why Valuation Is Last
Valuation is the final step for a reason. It only matters if the business has potential and financials are solid. A cheap stock with a broken business model isn't a bargain—it's a trap. The correct valuation of a business losing money in perpetuity is zero.

## Summary

By asking these six questions, you can break down even the most complex companies into simple, actionable insights. Start with the underlying business: what the company does and its unit economics. Then explore the opportunities, risks, and financials. Finally, assess whether the valuation makes sense based on your time horizon.
