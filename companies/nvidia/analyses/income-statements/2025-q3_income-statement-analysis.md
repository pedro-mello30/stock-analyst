# NVIDIA Q3 FY2026 (Quarter ended Oct 26, 2025) — Income Statement Analysis (from 10‑Q)

Primary sources:
- **Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income**: `../../inputs/sec-filings/10-q/2025-q3_form-10-q_oct26.pdf` p.3
- **Revenue by end market**: p.23
- **% of revenue table + narrative drivers**: p.27
- **Stock-based compensation + EPS mechanics**: p.10

## 1) Gather the data (what we have)
Income statement is presented for:
- **Three months ended** Oct 26, 2025 vs Oct 27, 2024
- **Nine months ended** Oct 26, 2025 vs Oct 27, 2024

All figures are **in millions (USD)** except per-share.

## 2) Revenue (top line): quality, growth, sustainability

### Reported revenue (GAAP)
From p.3:
- **Q3 FY26 revenue:** **$57,006M**
- **Q3 FY25 revenue:** $35,082M
  → **YoY growth: +62.5%**

- **9M FY26 revenue:** **$147,811M**
- **9M FY25 revenue:** $91,166M
  → **YoY growth: +62.1%**

### Revenue mix (end-market concentration)
From p.23 (three months ended):
- **Data Center:** **$51,215M** (vs $30,771M) → **+66.4% YoY**
- Gaming: $4,265M (vs $3,279M) → +30.1% YoY
- ProViz: $760M (vs $486M) → +56.4% YoY
- Automotive: $592M (vs $449M) → +31.8% YoY
- OEM & Other: $174M (vs $97M) → +79.4% YoY

Data Center is **~89.8% of quarterly revenue**, so revenue quality/sustainability is now heavily tied to continued AI infrastructure demand + supply/ramp execution.

Management color (p.27) points to:
- Mix shift from **Hopper HGX systems** to **Blackwell full-scale datacenter solutions**
- Sequential dynamics driven by **Blackwell ramp/mix** and networking shipment timing

## 3) Key margins (gross → operating → net)

### Q3 FY26 margins (three months ended)
Computed from p.3:
- **Gross margin:** (57,006 − 15,157) / 57,006 = **73.4%**
- **Operating margin:** 36,010 / 57,006 = **63.2%**
- **Net margin:** 31,910 / 57,006 = **56.0%**

Prior year (Q3 FY25):
- Gross margin **74.6%**
- Operating margin **62.3%**
- Net margin **55.0%**

**YoY margin deltas (Q3):**
- Gross margin: **-1.15 pp** (down)
- Operating margin: **+0.83 pp** (up)
- Net margin: **+0.94 pp** (up)

Interpretation:
- Despite slightly lower gross margin (mix/ramp transition), operating leverage and below-the-line items supported higher operating and net margins.

### 9M FY26 margins (nine months ended)
Computed from p.3:
- **Gross margin:** **69.3%** (vs 75.8% prior year, **-6.58 pp**)
- **Operating margin:** **58.2%** (vs 63.0%, **-4.74 pp**)
- **Net margin:** **52.2%** (vs 55.7%, **-3.54 pp**)

Interpretation:
- The YTD view shows a **material profitability compression**, consistent with the model transition/ramp costs and/or inventory provisions timing.

## 4) Operating expenses (efficiency and leverage)

From p.3 (three months ended):
- **R&D:** $4,705M (vs $3,390M) → +38.8% YoY
  As % revenue: **8.3%** (down from **9.7%**)
- **SG&A:** $1,134M (vs $897M) → +26.4% YoY
  As % revenue: **2.0%** (down from **2.6%**)
- **Total opex:** $5,839M (vs $4,287M)
  As % revenue: **10.3%** (down from **12.3%**)

This is clear operating leverage: opex grows strongly in dollars, but **revenue grows faster**, pushing opex % down.

Management explanation (p.27):
- Opex up due to **compute/infrastructure costs**, **higher compensation & benefits**, **employee growth**, and **engineering development costs** for new product introductions.

## 5) Compare across time (YoY patterns)

Key YoY growth (Q3):
- Revenue **+62.5%**
- Operating income **+64.7%** (36,010 vs 21,869)
- Net income **+65.3%** (31,910 vs 19,309)

But YTD (9M) shows:
- Revenue **+62.1%**
- Operating income **+49.9%**
- Net income **+51.8%**

So: **the quarter is exceptionally strong**, while **year-to-date profitability trails revenue growth**, likely reflecting earlier ramp/mix dynamics and cost pressures that are improving as the ramp matures.

---

## 6) Competitive benchmarking (high level)

No competitor financials are in this PDF, but in absolute terms:
- **~63% operating margin** is extremely high (well above typical software benchmarks like Microsoft ~43% in the repo reference sheet).
- This reflects NVIDIA’s current scarcity/pricing power and mix, but it also implies **future mean reversion risk** if supply normalizes or competition increases.

---

## 7) GAAP vs non-GAAP (what’s in this 10‑Q)

This 10‑Q is primarily **GAAP reporting**; there is no explicit “Non‑GAAP” reconciliation table in the document text.

However, the filing explicitly discloses **stock-based compensation (SBC)** embedded in GAAP expenses (p.10):
- SBC in Q3 FY26: **$1,655M** total
  - Cost of revenue: $70M
  - R&D: $1,206M
  - SG&A: $379M
- SBC in 9M FY26: **$4,753M** total

Analytical takeaway:
- If you look at “adjusted” profitability externally, be cautious about excluding SBC—**it’s a real ongoing cost** and meaningful in size.

# Summary: what the income statement says
- **Top-line:** Explosive growth (+62% YoY) with **very high concentration in Data Center (~90% of revenue)**.
- **Margins:** Q3 profitability remains extraordinary (GM 73%, OM 63%, NM 56%). Q3 margins are mostly stable YoY; YTD margins are down notably.
- **Efficiency:** Strong operating leverage—R&D and SG&A are declining as a % of revenue even while spending rises in dollars.
- **Key risk signals from P&L:** dependence on Data Center demand + ramp/mix transitions impacting gross margin; plus meaningful SBC magnitude.
